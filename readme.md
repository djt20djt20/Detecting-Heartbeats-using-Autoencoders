# Classifying Heartbeats using Autoencoders

In this project, I build an autoencoder in order to distinguish between 'normal' and 'abnormal' heartbeats. 

This repo provides the code used in the follwing article: https://medium.com/p/ed45255bd4fc

I built this model to explore the application of auto-encoders in anomoly detection for time-series
